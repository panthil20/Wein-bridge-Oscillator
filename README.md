Overview
The Wein Bridge Oscillator is a type of electronic oscillator that generates sine waves without any external input. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Wein Bridge Oscillator circuit, providing both the theoretical background and practical considerations.

Features
Sine Wave Generation: Produces a stable sine wave output.
Adjustable Frequency: Allows frequency adjustment via variable resistors.
Low Distortion: Designed for minimal signal distortion.
Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram shows the essential components and connections required for the Wein Bridge Oscillator. Ensure you have all the necessary parts before starting the assembly.

Components
Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp): 1x (e.g., LM741, TL082)
Resistors: 2x Fixed Resistors (R1, R2), 2x Variable Resistors (VR1, VR2)
Capacitors: 2x Capacitors (C1, C2)
Power Supply: Suitable DC power supply for the Op-Amp
Miscellaneous: Breadboard, connecting wires, etc.

Theory
The Wein Bridge Oscillator is based on a bridge circuit originally developed by Max Wien. It uses a combination of resistors and capacitors to provide feedback to an operational amplifier, creating oscillations. The frequency of the output signal is determined by the RC components.

Applications
Signal Generation: Used in applications requiring pure sine wave generation.
Audio Oscillators: Commonly used in audio testing and synthesis.
Function Generators: Can be part of a function generator circuit.
